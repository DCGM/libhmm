Definitions:

For the purpose of this agreement, Software shall mean a computer program (a group of computer programs functional as a unit) capable of copyright protection and accompanying documentation.

Work based on Software shall mean a work containing Software or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language, or a work based on Software. Portions of work not containing a portion of Software or not based on Software are not covered by this definition, if it is capable of independent use and distributed separately.

Source code shall mean all the source code for all modules of Software, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable program. Source code distributed with Software need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable program runs.

Anyone who uses Software becomes User. User shall abide by this licence agreement.

User may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and may offer war-ranty protection in exchange for a fee.
- User may modify his/her copy or copies of Software or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on Software, and copy and distribute such modifications or work, provided that User clearly states this work is modified Software. These modifications or work based on software may be distributed only under the terms of section 2 of this licence agreement, regardless if it is distributed alone or together with other work. Previous sentence does not apply to mere aggregation of another work not based on software with Software (or with a work based on software) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium.
- User shall accompany copies of Software or work based on software in object or executable form with:
- a) the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
- b) written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than actual cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corres-ponding source code, to be distributed on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
- c) the information User received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alterna-tive is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if User received the program in objects code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with subsection b above.)
- User may not copy, modify, grant sublicences or distribute Software in any other way than expressly pro-vided for in this licence agreement. Any other copying, modifying, granting of sublicences or distribution of Software is illegal and will automatically result in termination of the rights granted by this licence.

- User may not use and/or distribute Software, if he/she cannot satisfy simultaneously obligations under this licence and any other pertinent obligations.

Final provisions:

Any provision of this licence agreement that is prohibited, unenforceable, or not authorized in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition, unenforceability, or non-authorization without invalidating or affecting the remaining provisions.

This licence agreement provides in essentials the same extent of rights as the terms of GNU GPL version 2 and Software fulfils the requirements of Open Source software.
